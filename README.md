# Data-Structures

Linked List:
-We can perform any function on linked list if we know how to traverse the linked list. 
-We can create nodes of Linked List dynamically and stores their addressess in the pointer of Node type.
-then we can link all the Nodes by storing the pointer of next Node in the current Node and it continues till NULL.
-Null declares the end of Linked List.
-(headptr!=NULL)  and (head=head->next;) are two most useful conditions for performing any type of operation on Linked List.
-for inserting, updating, deleting any node by taking Index we can declare local index variable that continues to increase till it reaches the desired index to perform operation.
-for updating and deleting by taking data we can declare one extra Node type pointer in order to grab the previous Node and perform operation.
